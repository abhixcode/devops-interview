API Testing
===========

Postman collection JSON file has been added to the repository - comprising of two test cases:
  1. To test GET response 200 OK for Location API
  2. To test GET response 200 OK for Current Condition API

The automated testing (job "test") is integrated into CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions.
